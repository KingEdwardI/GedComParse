// how to determine connections...?
  // @Fx@ but still confused about how they connect.
  // nearing the bottom of the file is personal relations each entry begins with @Fx@
  // relations are stated as:
    // HUSB == husband
    // WIFE == wife
    // CHIL == child
    // _FREL Natural == father relation is natural
    // _MREL Natural == mother relation is natural
      // if these are not stated it could mean that the parental relation is not natural. however there is no information to determine otherwise
  // relations with the @Fx@ are stated by the preceding map and are determined by @Px@, which relates to their entry in the above document.
    // i.e. 0 @P220@ INDI
// BUT how does the @Fx@ connect with each person.
  // more than one person will contain the same @Fx@ indicator. 
  // may relate to @Px@ location. @Px@ = @Fx@ ???
  // this will take some digging...this is becoming painful.
